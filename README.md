# Earth From Space
Developed an Earth model using Three.js, enhancing its realism by incorporating custom displacement mapping to accurately depict mountains, plateaus, and canyons. To further enrich the visual experience, I implemented a custom shader to simulate the Earth's atmosphere and dynamic cloud movement.

The model allows for self-rotation and provides users with the ability to adjust the rotation speed and toggle cloud layer visibility. Additionally, users can choose to display the moon and control its rotation and revolution speeds. For comparison, the moon employs Three.js's built-in displacement mapping.
